## Analysis

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this analysis of Booking Holdings (BKNG) based on the AI-Native Companies Strategy framework. The user wants a detailed evaluation across three dimensions: AI Nativeness, AI Product Value, and Pre-existing Hype. 

First, I need to understand each scoring criterion thoroughly. For AI Nativeness, it's about how deeply AI is integrated into the company's core operations beyond just their products. I should look into how they use AI internally for things like software development, customer service, etc. The search results mention Booking.com's AI Trip Planner, Smart Filter, and Property Q&A features. They also talk about using AI for code migration and developer tools. There's a mention of Sourcegraph agents for code reviews and migrations, which suggests significant internal AI use. The CFO mentioned efficiency gains in customer service and sales, which ties into operational use. They have a GenAI task force and investments in data infrastructure. This seems like more than just surface-level use; they're integrating AI into their core processes, so maybe a 7-8 here.

Next, AI Product Value. The user wants to know if their AI-powered products are strong in the market. Booking.com has the AI Trip Planner, Smart Filter, Property Q&A, and Review Summaries. These features are highlighted in multiple sources, including partnerships with OpenAI. They also mention growth in connected trips and Genius loyalty tiers, which are likely supported by AI personalization. The AI Trip Planner is integrated with real-time data and has evolved since 2023. However, while these features are significant, they might not be completely transformative yet. The products are enhancing user experience but perhaps aren't the sole revenue drivers. Maybe a 7 here, as they have a strong portfolio but not market-leading in every aspect.

Pre-existing Hype. The company is frequently mentioned in AI travel discussions, partnerships with major AI players like OpenAI and Microsoft, and appearances in earnings calls. They're part of industry reports and have media coverage, but they're not as dominant in AI hype as companies like NVIDIA. The stock might not be as overvalued purely on AI expectations. They have high visibility in the travel sector but aren't the top AI stock in the market. So perhaps a 6-7, considering their presence in travel AI but not extreme hype levels.

Wait, need to cross-reference the data points. The AI Nativeness section: they use AI for code migration (reducing a 10-year project to months), customer service automation (saving costs), internal tools for developers, and data infrastructure. The CFO mentioned measurable efficiency gains. That sounds like advancing (7-8). For AI Product Value, their features are core to the user experience, with personalized trips and real-time integration. They're expanding vertically and seeing increased bookings, which suggests strong product value. High 7. Hype: they're featured in Skift, PhocusWire, earnings calls, but not leading all AI discussions. Maybe a 7, as they're prominent in their industry but not the top AI hype stock overall.

I should structure the analysis into sections, discussing each criterion with evidence from the search results, then assign scores. Make sure to cite sources properly. Also, avoid lists and use narrative flow. Need to ensure each section has paragraphs connecting the points, citing the relevant sources inline. Then present the JSON at the end.

# Analysis of Booking Holdings (BKNG) as an AI-Native Company

## 1. AI Nativeness: Strategic Integration Across Core Operations  
Booking Holdings demonstrates **advanced integration of AI into its operational DNA**, particularly in software development, customer service, and supply chain optimization. The company has moved beyond experimental deployments to establish AI as a cornerstone of its technological infrastructure.  

### Foundational AI Infrastructure  
The company’s engineering teams leverage AI-driven tools for code migration, testing, and infrastructure management. A partnership with Sourcegraph has enabled automated code reviews and large-scale legacy system migrations, reducing a projected 10-year replatforming effort to months[10][19]. Internal benchmarks show developers using AI tools merge **30% more pull requests monthly** compared to non-users[10]. This operational efficiency is reinforced by a centralized AI platform integrating natural language processing (NLP) models with proprietary booking data[3][14].  

### AI-Optimized Workflows  
- **Customer Service**: AI handles **40% of support interactions**, with tools like GenAI Orchestrator automating responses to common queries (e.g., pet policies, cancellation rules)[4][18].  
- **Supplier Enablement**: Hotel
