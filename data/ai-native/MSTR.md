# Research Analysis: MSTR

## Analysis

<think>
Okay, I need to analyze MicroStrategy (MSTR) based on the three criteria provided: AI Nativeness, AI Product Value, and Pre-existing Hype. Let's start by going through each of these one by one, using the search results and any other available information.

First, AI Nativeness. The rubric here focuses on how deeply AI is integrated into the company's core operations beyond just their products. Looking at the search results, there's mention of their AI-powered analytics platform, MicroStrategy ONE. They have features like Auto AI bot, HyperIntelligence, and automated dashboards. The company seems to be using AI for internal processes, like their Semantic Layer for data consistency and AI-driven development tools. They also have job postings for AI Engineers, which suggests investment in AI talent. However, I need to check if this is integral to their operations or just product-focused. The search results mention automated dashboards and integrating AI into workflows, which might count towards operational use. Their R&D expenses
