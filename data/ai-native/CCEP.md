# Research Analysis: CCEP

**Generated:** Sat May 31 17:34:22 2025

## Analysis

<think>
Okay, I need to analyze Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP) based on the three criteria provided: AI Nativeness, AI Product Value, and Pre-existing Hype. Let's start by going through each criterion one by one, using the search results provided.

First, **AI Nativeness**. The user wants to know how deeply AI is integrated into CCEP's core operations beyond just their products. Looking at the search results, there's a lot about their digital transformation. For example, they've implemented AI for demand forecasting, which improved accuracy from 70% to 90% [1][9]. They also use IoT and digital twins in manufacturing, leading to a 15% increase in operational efficiency [1][51]. They partnered with IBM for AI-powered procurement analytics, saving $40 million overall [4][19][50][65]. They have a Senior Data Scientist role focused on Bayesian models for commercial applications [7]. Additionally, their vending machines use AI for image recognition and seamless transactions [6][14][33][69]. They even invested $1.1B in a Microsoft AI partnership for cloud and AI tech [2][3][66]. However, much of this seems focused on optimizing existing processes rather than transformative AI-native operations. They aren't using AI to code or create self-optimizing systems, so maybe they fall into the "Advancing" category but not the top tier.

Next, **AI Product Value**. CCEP's main products are beverages, so their AI use is more about enhancing operations and customer experience rather than selling AI products. They have AI-driven vending machines (Coke&Go) [6][14][33][69], personalized marketing campaigns using AI analytics [9][24][30], and AI in supply chain management [1][38][51]. These add value internally and improve customer engagement but aren't standalone AI products. There's no mention of CCEP selling AI tools or platforms. So their AI Product Value is more about enhancing existing offerings rather than creating new AI-driven products. This might place them in the "Valuable AI Product" category since AI contributes to their core offerings but isn't the product itself.

For **Pre-existing Hype**, CCEP isn't typically highlighted as an AI leader in mainstream media. They are mentioned in industry-specific reports and have some media coverage about their AI initiatives [1][2][24][66]. However, they aren't featured in major AI stock lists or ETFs. Their stock performance and analyst ratings [16][27][44][45] note solid fundamentals but don't emphasize AI as a primary growth driver. The hype seems moderate, with some recognition in specialized circles but not widespread investor frenzy. They might be in the "Moderate Hype" range.

Putting it all together: AI Nativeness around 7 (Advancing), AI Product Value around 5 (Valuable but not core), and Pre-existing Hype around 5 (Moderate). Need to ensure consistency with the rubric and data points from the sources.

### Comprehensive Analysis of Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP)

#### **1. AI Nativeness: 7/10 (Advancing)**  
CCEP demonstrates advanced integration of AI into core operations, particularly in supply chain optimization, manufacturing, and customer engagement. Key initiatives include:  
- **AI-Driven Demand Forecasting**: Improved accuracy from 70% to 90% using machine learning algorithms, enabling optimized production planning and inventory management [1][9][51].  
- **Digital Twins and IoT**: Real-time monitoring of manufacturing processes via digital twins reduced downtime by 15% and enhanced operational efficiency [1][51].  
- **Procurement Transformation**: IBM-powered AI analytics streamlined procurement, generating $40M+ in business benefits, including $5M annual savings from improved category management [4][19][50][65].  
- **AI-Powered Vending Machines**: Coke&Go coolers use image recognition and AI for contactless purchases, reducing waste through smart inventory tracking [6][14][33][69].  
- **Microsoft Partnership**: $1.1B investment in Azure OpenAI and generative AI tools to enhance marketing, supply chain, and internal workflows [2][3][66].  

While CCEP leverages AI extensively for operational efficiency, its use of AI in software development (e.g., AI-generated code) remains limited. AI adoption is strategic but focused on incremental improvements rather than transformative, autonomous systems.  

---

#### **2. AI Product Value: 5/10 (Valuable AI Product)**  
CCEP’s AI applications enhance its beverage business but do not constitute standalone AI products:  
- **Personalized Marketing**: AI analytics drive campaigns like "Share a Coke," contributing to a 2% sales lift [9][24].  
- **Smart Vending Solutions**: Coke&GO improves customer experience through frictionless transactions, though this is an enhancement to existing infrastructure [6][33][69].  
- **Sustainability Innovations**: Partnerships with startups like Avalo use AI to develop climate-resilient sugarcane, reducing scope 3 emissions [68].  

AI is critical to CCEP’s value proposition in efficiency and customer engagement but does not generate direct AI product revenue. Differentiation stems from operational execution rather than AI-driven product innovation.  

---

#### **3. Pre-existing Hype: 5/10 (Moderate Hype)**  
CCEP receives specialized recognition for AI adoption but lacks mainstream AI investor attention:  
- **Industry Recognition**: Featured in supply chain and digital transformation case studies (IBM, Deloitte) [4][35][63].  
- **Limited ETF Inclusion**: Not prominently listed in AI-focused ETFs or indexes, though analysts note its digital initiatives [15][46].  
- **Stock Performance**: Shares hit 52-week highs in 2025, driven by operational results rather than AI hype [16][45].  
- **Media Coverage**: Niche tech outlets highlight AI projects, but mainstream narratives focus on traditional metrics [24][41][59].  

CCEP’s AI narrative is growing but remains secondary to its core beverage business in market discussions.
