## Analysis

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this analysis of Constellation Energy (CEG) based on the user's scoring framework. The user wants a detailed evaluation across three dimensions: AI Nativeness, AI Product Value, and Pre-existing Hype. 

First, I need to understand each scoring criteria thoroughly. For AI Nativeness, the focus is on how deeply AI is integrated into the company's core operations beyond just products. Looking at the search results, I see mentions of Constellation's use of AI in grid management and energy optimization. For example, they have an AI platform called Constellation Navigator that helps customers manage their energy usage and sustainability goals[19]. There's also a case study where they worked with a grid intelligence startup using MLOps for infrastructure assessment[12]. Additionally, they're hiring a Senior Software/Data Engineer focused on AI[13], which suggests investment in AI talent. However, their core operations are still energy generation and distribution, so AI is a tool rather than the foundation. This might place them in the 5-6 range (Integrating) since they have measurable productivity gains but aren't fully AI-driven.

Next, AI Product Value. The user is looking for AI-powered products that generate revenue. Constellation's main AI-related product seems to be their energy solutions for data centers, particularly using nuclear power to support AI data centers. They have partnerships with Microsoft and others, providing carbon-free energy through PPAs[6][9][15][17]. They also offer Constellation Navigator as a service[19]. These products are valuable, especially with the growing demand for sustainable energy in AI, but the AI component here is more about enabling AI infrastructure rather than being an AI product itself. So maybe a 5-6 (Valuable AI Product), as the AI aspect is a significant component but not the core product.

For Pre-existing Hype, the stock has surged due to their focus on AI data centers[8][18]. They're frequently mentioned in media related to AI and energy[6][7][10][17]. However, they're not as hyped as pure AI companies like Nvidia. The stock price has risen significantly, and there's a lot of analyst coverage linking them to AI growth[1][8][18]. This might put them at 7-8 (High Hype) since they're prominently featured in AI discussions but not at the extreme level.

I need to ensure each score is backed by the search results. For example, AI Nativeness references their internal tools and job postings, AI Product Value
