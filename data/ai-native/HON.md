## Analysis

<think>
Okay, I need to analyze Honeywell (HON) based on the three criteria provided: AI Nativeness, AI Product Value, and Pre-existing Hype. Let me start by going through each of the search results to gather relevant information.

First, AI Nativeness. The user wants to know how deeply AI is integrated into Honeywell's core operations. From the search results, I see that Honeywell has partnered with Microsoft to deploy generative AI tools across their global operations, impacting 95,000 employees. Specifically, they've used Microsoft 365 Copilot and GitHub Copilot, which has increased productivity. For example, GitHub Copilot is used by over 4,500 software engineers, generating 90,000 lines of code weekly with a 65% utilization rate. They also reduced IT help desk tickets by 80% using Moveworks' AI copilot. These are significant internal efficiencies. Additionally, they're developing a large language model to speed up specification writing from a month to minutes. Their data infrastructure with Snowflake and a consolidated software stack from 4,500 to 1,000 apps shows strategic data management for AI. This seems like widespread adoption with measurable gains, so maybe a 7 or 8 here.

Next, AI Product Value. Honeywell has several AI-powered products. Their Experion Operations Assistant uses explainable AI to help operators in industrial processes. They have Honeywell Forge IoT platform with AI capabilities across 100M+ connected assets. In retail, their Guided Work Solutions use AI-driven speech tech for associates. They also have AI solutions in energy, aviation autonomy, and partnerships with Qualcomm and Google Cloud for AI agents. These products are integrated into key sectors like aviation, energy, and retail, providing clear customer benefits. Revenue from software was ~$2B in 2024, which is a tangible contribution. However, while they have multiple products, are they considered best-in-class? They might be strong but not market-leading. Maybe a 7 here as well.

Pre-existing Hype. Honeywell is mentioned in some AI ETFs like AIEQ and EasyETFs AI World. They’re featured in press releases and industry articles, but not as dominant as companies like Nvidia. They have partnerships with major tech firms, which gets them media coverage. However, their stock isn’t as hyped as pure AI companies. They’re included in discussions but not leading the narrative. The investor PDF mentions their AI initiatives, but the hype level might be moderate. Maybe a 5 or 6.

Need to cross-verify the scores with the rubrics. For AI Nativeness, they’re using AI across operations with significant productivity gains, which fits the 7-8 range (Advancing to Advancing). AI Product Value: multiple strong products but not market-defining, so 7. Pre-existing Hype: moderate, not extreme, so 5 or 6. Let me check the ETFs again. AIEQ holds HON, and EasyETFs includes them. They’re part of the AI conversation but not top-tier hype. Maybe 6 for hype.

Final scores: AI Nativeness 8, AI Product Value 7, Pre-existing Hype 6.
