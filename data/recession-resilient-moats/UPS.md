# Research Analysis: UPS

## Analysis

<think>
Okay, I need to analyze UPS based on the four criteria provided: Pricing Power, Recession History, Debt Burden (inverse scoring), and Cyclicality (inverse scoring). Let's start by going through each criterion one by one, using the search results and any other information I have.

First, Pricing Power. The rubric says to look at historical pricing trends, gross margin stability during downturns, competitor pricing, brand strength, etc. From the search results, UPS implemented a 5.9% average rate increase in 2024 and another 5.9% in 2025. They also have fuel surcharges that adjust weekly. The fact that they can consistently raise prices, even during periods when competitors like FedEx are doing the same, suggests some pricing power. However, the search results also mention that shippers are looking to mitigate these increases by optimizing packages or switching methods. So while UPS has some ability to raise prices, the market is competitive, and customers might have alternatives. Also, their SurePost service is more expensive than UPS Ground Residential, which might indicate segmentation but not absolute pricing power. Maybe a 7-8 range here? They can raise prices but face competition.

Next, Recession History. The user wants how the company performed in past recessions. Looking at the financial results, in 2023, UPS's revenue was $90.96 billion, down 9% from 2022. During COVID (2020), revenue increased to $84.6 billion, but net income dropped to $1.3 billion. In Q1 2025, revenue dipped slightly but operating profit increased. During the 2008 crisis, their revenue dropped from $49.6B in 2007 to $45.2B in 2009, and net income fell sharply. So there's some vulnerability during severe recessions but not catastrophic. The 2020 pandemic saw a revenue increase but profit decline. Maybe a 5-6 because they had declines but maintained operations without needing bailouts. However, in 2023, they had a significant revenue drop post-pandemic. Need to check more data points.

Debt Burden. The inverse score, so higher is better. Search result 16 mentions a debt-to-equity ratio of 133.3%, which is 1.33x. According to the rubric, debt-to-equity 1-2x is moderate leverage (5-6). But since this is inverse, a 5-6 would translate to a score of 5-6 for debt burden? Wait, the inverse scoring means that a high debt burden gets a low score. So if UPS has a debt-to-equity of 1.33x, which is in the 1-2x range, that's moderate leverage, which would be a 5-6 in the debt burden category (since lower debt is better). But the inverse scoring says 10 = minimal debt. So a 1.33x debt-to-equity ratio would be in the 5-6 range for the inverse score. The interest coverage ratio is 44.6x, which is very high, so that's good. Maybe the debt burden score is higher because the interest coverage is strong. The rubric says for 7-8 (conservative leverage), debt-to-equity 0.3-1x. UPS is at 1.33x, which is above that, so maybe 5-6. But the interest coverage is excellent, which might push it higher. Maybe a 7? Because even though debt-to-equity is 1.33, interest coverage is 44.6x, which is way above the 8x needed for 7-8. So perhaps a 7.

Cyclicality. Inverse scoring again. The company's exposure to economic cycles. UPS is in logistics and parcel delivery, which is somewhat tied to economic activity. However, e-commerce has made parcel delivery more resilient. During recessions, maybe B2B shipping decreases, but consumer e-commerce might hold up. Search result 11 mentions that UPS's volume declined in 2023, but they maintained profitability through cost-cutting. In 2020, revenue increased, suggesting some counter-cyclical aspects due to e-commerce. However, in 2023, post-pandemic, revenue dropped as demand normalized. So they are somewhat cyclical but have elements of resilience. The rubric for 7-8 (low cyclicality) is revenue swings <10%. Looking at historical data from search result 18, revenue dropped from $97.2B in 2021 to $90.9B in 2023, about a 6.5% drop over two years. During 2008-2009, revenue dropped from $49.6B to $45.2B, a 9% drop. So maybe moderate cyclicality, with revenue swings around 10-25%, which would be 5-6 inverse score. But considering e-commerce's growth, maybe it's becoming less cyclical. Hmm. Maybe a 6 for cyclicality (inverse), meaning moderate cyclicality.

Putting it all together:

Pricing Power: 7 (Strong, can raise prices but competitive pressures)
Recession History: 6 (Moderate resilience, some declines but managed)
Debt Burden: 7 (Conservative leverage due to high interest coverage despite D/E ratio)
Cyclicality: 6 (Moderate cyclicality, some swings but e-commerce support)

Wait, the user provided a JSON example with each score as an integer. Need to make sure each is between 1-10. Let me verify each again.

Pricing Power: UPS has consistent rate increases, but in a competitive market with FedEx and DHL. They can push through GRIs, but customers may switch. Recent 5.9% increases, similar to FedEx. Maybe a 7.

Recession History: During 2008, revenue dropped ~9%, earnings fell more. In 2020, revenue up but profits down. 2023 saw a revenue drop. So during recessions, they have declines but not catastrophic. Maybe a 6.

Debt Burden: Debt-to-equity 1.33x (moderate) but interest coverage 44.6x (very strong). The rubric for 7-8 is D/E 0.3-1x and interest coverage >8x. UPS's D/E is higher, but interest coverage is excellent. Since interest coverage is a key factor, maybe score 7.

Cyclicality: Their business is tied to trade and economic activity, but e-commerce provides some cushion. Revenue swings around 10% in past recessions. So inverse score 6 (moderate cyclicality).

**Comprehensive Analysis**

**1. Pricing Power (7/10)**  
UPS demonstrates strong but not exceptional pricing power in the logistics sector. The company has consistently implemented annual general rate increases (GRIs) of 5.9% in both 2024 and 2025, matching FedEx's hikes[4][10]. This pricing discipline is supported by UPS's position as the parcel revenue market leader (35% share)[11] and its ability to pass through fuel surcharges dynamically[1][2]. However, three factors constrain scoring:  
- **Competitive Parity**: No premium over FedEx's pricing, with DHL and regional carriers pressuring international margins[6][14]  
- **Customer Elasticity**: 12% residential delivery cost increases drove shipper optimization efforts[1][3]  
- **Service Segmentation**: SurePost rates rose disproportionately (up to 36% for heavy packages)[3][14], indicating pricing power varies by service tier  

Margin resilience during the 2023 demand contraction (8.2% Q1 2025 operating margin)[17] and contractual agreements with enterprise shippers support the 7-score, but lack of monopolistic positioning prevents higher ratings.

**2. Recession History (6/10)**  
UPS shows moderate recession resilience with mixed historical performance:  
- **2008-2009**: Revenue declined 9.2% ($49.6B→$45.2B), EPS fell 44% ($4.11→$2.31)[19]  
- **2020**: 11% revenue growth ($84.6B) but net income dropped 89% ($12.8B→$1.3B)[18] due to COVID costs  
- **2023**: 9% revenue decline ($100.3B→$90.9B) post-pandemic normalization[18]  

Recent improvements include:  
- Q4 2024 operating margin expansion to 11.6% during economic slowdown[5]  
- 4.5% revenue-per-piece growth in Q1 2025 despite volume declines[17]  

The 6-score reflects UPS's ability to maintain profitability through cost controls ($3.5B savings program)[17] but acknowledges vulnerability to >10% revenue declines in severe downturns.

**3. Debt Burden (7/10 Inverse)**  
UPS balances moderate leverage with exceptional interest coverage:  
- **Debt/Equity**: 133.3% (1.33x)[16]  
- **Interest Coverage**: 44.6x EBIT/Interest[16]  
- **Liquidity**: $5.1B cash + $3.3B annual FCF[17][18]  

While the debt ratio exceeds ideal levels (0.3-1x for top scores), UPS's AA- credit rating[16] and ability to generate $8B+ annual operating cash flow[5] justify a 7-score. The company reduced debt/equity from 848.9% to 133.3% since 2018[16], showing active balance sheet management.

**4. Cyclicality (6/10 Inverse)**  
UPS exhibits moderated cyclicality through diversification:  
- **E-Commerce Anchor**: 6.5% YoY U.S. domestic volume growth (2024)[9] offsets industrial weakness  
- **Global Network**: 7.1% Q1 2025 international volume growth from APAC cross-border[17]  
- **Essential Services**: 72% of 2024 revenue from business-critical logistics[7][12]  

However, remaining exposure appears in:  
- 14.8% Supply Chain Solutions revenue drop (2025)[17]  
- 10.3% 2023 parcel volume decline[11]  
- 9% 2022-2023 revenue contraction[18]  

The 6-score (equivalent to "Mixed Cyclicality") recognizes UPS's progress in building recession-resilient revenue streams while maintaining ties to global trade cycles.
