# Research Analysis: NEE

## Analysis

<think>
Okay, I need to analyze NextEra Energy (NEE) based on the four criteria provided: Pricing Power, Recession History, Debt Burden (inverse scoring), and Cyclicality (inverse scoring). Let me start by going through each criterion step by step, using the search results provided.

Starting with Pricing Power. The user's rubric says that Pricing Power is about the company's ability to maintain or increase prices without losing market share, especially during economic stress. The data points include historical pricing trends, gross margin stability, competitor actions, customer concentration, brand strength, switching costs, and regulatory barriers.

Looking at the search results, NEE operates through FPL and NEER. FPL is a regulated utility in Florida, which means its pricing is subject to regulatory approval. Regulated utilities typically have some pricing power because they operate as monopolies in their regions, and regulators allow them to recover costs plus a reasonable return. For example, search result [1] mentions that FPL's revenue comes from regulated operations, which are less risky and provide stable cash flows. Additionally, [19] states that FPL is a regulated monopoly, which implies that they have a captive customer base with limited alternatives. However, their ability to raise prices is constrained by regulatory approvals. Search result [8] talks about FPL filing a rate plan that would increase customer
