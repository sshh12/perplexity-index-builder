# Research Analysis: STZ

**Generated:** Sun Jun  1 01:31:14 2025

## Analysis

<think>
Okay, let's dive into analyzing STZ (Constellation Brands) using the four criteria outlined. Starting with Pricing Power. Constellation has a strong portfolio of premium beer brands like Corona and Modelo, which are market leaders. Their focus on high-end products might give them some pricing leverage. Looking at historical data, their gross margins have been stable even during past economic downturns, suggesting they can maintain prices without losing customers. They've also been able to pass on cost increases to consumers, especially in the beer segment. However, the wine and spirits division has faced more challenges, which might limit their overall pricing power. Considering their brand strength and market position, especially in beer, I'd lean towards a higher score here, maybe around 7 or 8.

Next, Recession History. Let's look at how STZ performed during previous recessions. During the 2008 crisis, their revenue declined but not drastically. More recently, during the 2020 COVID pandemic, their beer sales remained resilient, while wine and spirits saw a dip. In the 2022-2023 inflationary period, they managed to grow revenue, indicating some resilience. However, their reliance on discretionary spending in the alcohol sector means they aren't completely immune. They haven't shown counter-cyclical growth, but they've maintained profitability. This might place them in the 6-7 range, showing moderate resilience with some vulnerability in specific segments.

Moving to Debt Burden. Their debt-to-equity ratio is around 1.6x, which is higher than ideal. They have significant debt from acquisitions, like the Grupo Modelo deal. However, their interest coverage ratio is healthy at around 8x, thanks to strong cash flows from their beer business. They've been actively managing debt, refinancing to lower rates, and have a manageable maturity profile. While the debt is substantial, their ability to generate consistent cash flow helps mitigate risks. This might score around 5-6, indicating moderate leverage but with solid coverage.

Lastly, Cyclicality. The alcohol industry is generally considered defensive, but premium segments can be more sensitive to economic cycles. STZ's beer portfolio, especially Corona and Modelo, has shown resilience, as these are everyday brands with loyal followings. However, their wine and spirits business, particularly premium wines, is more discretionary and thus more cyclical. Overall, the company has a mix, but the majority of revenue comes from beer. This might warrant a score around 7, indicating low cyclicality but not entirely immune.

After weighing all factors, the scores would reflect strong pricing power in beer, moderate recession resilience, manageable debt with good coverage, and low cyclicality due to their dominant beer segment. However, the wine division's struggles and higher debt levels slightly temper the scores.

**Comprehensive Analysis of Constellation Brands (STZ)**

### 1. Pricing Power  
**Score: 7/10**  
Constellation Brands demonstrates **strong pricing power**, particularly in its beer segment. The company’s imported beer portfolio (Corona, Modelo Especial, Pacifico) dominates the U.S. high-end market, with Modelo Especial claiming the #1 beer position by dollar sales[2][6]. These brands benefit from premiumization trends, customer loyalty, and limited competition in the Mexican import category. Gross margins in beer have remained stable at ~52%[4], even during inflationary periods, reflecting an ability to pass on costs. However, pricing power is weaker in wine/spirits (24% of sales), where competitive pressures and consumer downtrading persist[4][10]. Recent divestitures of value wine brands (e.g., Clos du Bois)[10] and focus on premium labels (Robert Mondavi, The Prisoner) aim to strengthen pricing, but wine margins remain compressed compared to beer[13][24].  

### 2. Recession History  
**Score: 6/10**  
STZ shows **moderate recession resilience**. During the 2020 COVID-19 recession, beer depletions grew 12.1% YoY[15], benefiting from at-home consumption, while wine/spirits declined 9%[24]. In the 2008 crisis, revenue fell 4% but recovered within two years[52]. However, the wine segment remains vulnerable: Fiscal 2025 Q4 wine sales dropped 16.4% amid consumer pullbacks[60], and the company is divesting non-core wine assets to focus on premium beer[60][69]. Beer has consistently outperformed broader alcohol categories, with 59 consecutive quarters of growth through 2024[23], but STZ revised long-term beer growth forecasts downward (7-9% to 2-4%)[65], reflecting sensitivity to macroeconomic pressures.  

### 3. Debt Burden (Inverse Scoring)  
**Score: 5/10**  
STZ carries **moderate leverage** with room for improvement. Net debt stands at $12.7B (debt/EBITDA: 3.1x)[19], above industry peers, but manageable given strong beer cash flows. Interest coverage remains healthy at 8.5x[19], supported by $3.4B annual operating cash flow[13]. Recent refinancing extended maturities (2030 notes at 4.8%)[34], and the company targets debt/EBITDA ≤3x by 2026[12]. However, $2B in brewery expansion capex through 2028[59] could pressure near-term flexibility. Liquidity is robust with $1.1B cash and $2.25B credit facility[19].  

### 4. Cyclicality (Inverse Scoring)  
**Score: 7/10**  
STZ exhibits **low cyclicality** in beer but mixed exposure in wine. The beer segment (76% of sales)[4] benefits from consistent demand—Hispanic consumers (35% of volume)[28] and younger demographics drive stable consumption. However, premiumization trends introduce mild cyclicality, as higher-priced beers may face pressure in severe downturns. Wine/spirits (24% of sales) is more discretionary, with recent declines tied to economic softness[60]. Overall, 85% of STZ’s portfolio is in non-discretionary or “affordable luxury” categories[6], providing recession cushioning distinct from luxury spirits or craft beer.
