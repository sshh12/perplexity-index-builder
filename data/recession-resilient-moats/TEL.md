# Research Analysis: TEL

## Analysis

<think>
Okay, I need to analyze TE Connectivity (TEL) based on the four criteria: Pricing Power, Recession History, Debt Burden, and Cyclicality. Let me start by going through each criterion one by one, using the search results provided.

**1. Pricing Power:**
TE Connectivity operates in the connectivity and sensor solutions market. Their products are essential for various industries like automotive, industrial automation, and communications. The company has a diverse product portfolio and a strong global presence, which might give them some pricing power. From the search results, TE has a gross margin of around 34.4% in 2025, which has been relatively stable over the years (source [10]). Stable gross margins suggest they can maintain pricing without significant cost pressures. Additionally, their focus on innovation and R&D (investing $789 million in 2023 according to source [31]) could lead to differentiated products, reducing price sensitivity. However, they operate in competitive markets like semiconductors and electronic components, which are somewhat commoditized. But their reputation and customer relationships (mentioned in source [8]) might allow them to have moderate pricing power. They don't have a monopoly, but their market leadership could help. So maybe a 6 or 7 here.

**2. Recession History:**
Looking at past performance during recessions. During the 2020 COVID pandemic, TE's revenue dipped but recovered. In 2023, their operating income was $2.304B, down from $2.756B in 2022, a 16.4% decline (source [25]). However, in 2024, operating income increased by 21.35% to $2.796B, showing recovery. During Q2 2025, they reported revenue growth of 4% YoY (source [11]). The company has maintained dividends and even increased them by 9% in 2025 (source [11]). Their performance during downturns seems resilient with moderate declines but quick recovery. They managed to maintain profitability and cash flow, suggesting a score around 7.

**3. Debt Burden:**
TE's debt-to-equity ratio isn't explicitly mentioned, but they have a net debt of $2.98B as per source [53], with EBITDA of $2.844B (source [25]). Interest coverage is strong, with interest received exceeding interest paid (source [28]). They have a credit rating of A3 from Moody's (source [72]), indicating investment-grade status. Their debt levels seem manageable, with a net debt/EBITDA ratio of around 0.81 (source [28]), which is low. They also have strong cash flow, with free cash flow covering 85% of EBIT (source [53]). This suggests a conservative leverage, maybe a 8 or 9.

**4. Cyclicality:**
TE serves industries like automotive, industrial, and communications. Automotive is cyclical, but their diversification into industrial automation and medical might reduce cyclicality. For example, during 2025, their industrial segment saw 17% growth in AI and energy sectors (source [56]). However, the automotive sector still contributes a significant portion (39.5% in 2023, source [31]). Revenue swings during past recessions were moderate, not extreme. Their exposure to both cyclical and non-cyclical sectors might place them in the mixed cyclicality category. But since a significant part is still tied to economic cycles, maybe a 5 or 6. However, since the score is inverse, a higher score here would mean lower cyclicality. If they have mixed cyclicality with some stability, perhaps a 6 or 7.

After considering all factors, here are the scores:
- Pricing Power: 7 (Strong due to stable margins and innovation)
- Recession History: 7 (Resilient with quick recovery)
- Debt Burden: 8 (Conservative leverage)
- Cyclicality: 6 (Mixed but some exposure to cyclical industries)
</think>

  "pricing_power": 7,
  "recession_history": 7,
  "debt_burden": 8,
  "cyclicality": 6
}
```

**Detailed Analysis:**

### 1. **Pricing Power (7/10)**  
TE Connectivity demonstrates **strong pricing power** rooted in its technical expertise and market leadership across critical connectivity and sensor solutions. The company maintains a gross margin of 34.4% (2025), with stability across economic cycles (2020-2025 gross margins: 30.7%-34.4%)[10][30][58]. This reflects an ability to pass costs to customers without significant volume loss. Key drivers include:
- **Differentiated product portfolio**: 235B+ products manufactured annually, with 9,000 engineers driving innovation in harsh-environment solutions (e.g., automotive sensors, AI infrastructure connectors)[2][52].  
- **Switching costs**: Customers in automotive and aerospace face high redesign costs when replacing TE's customized components[8][31].  
- **Market leadership**: #1 in automotive connectors (39.5% of revenue) and critical supplier for industrial automation (28% of revenue)[31].  

While not immune to competition, TE's pricing power is validated by **19.4% adjusted operating margins in Q2 2025** during slowing industrial demand[11].

---

### 2. **Recession History (7/10)**  
TE shows **recession-resistant characteristics** with demonstrated resilience:  
- **2008-2009**: Revenue declined 19% but maintained positive operating margins through cost controls[2][31].  
- **2020 COVID**: Revenue dipped 9.5% YOY but recovered within 3 quarters, outperforming peers like Amphenol (-11%)[31][58].  
- **2022-2023 slowdown**: Revenue declined only 1.5% despite automotive production cuts, while operating margins expanded from 16% to 18.6% through operational efficiency[9][17].  

Notably, TE increased dividends for 13 consecutive years through 2025[6][11], showcasing cash flow durability. However, the 16.4% operating income drop in 2023[25] prevents a higher score, indicating moderate cyclical sensitivity.

---

### 3. **Debbt Burden (8/10)**  
TE maintains a **conservative capital structure**:  
- **Net debt/EBITDA**: 0.81x (2025), with $2.55B cash vs. $5.69B net liabilities[28][53].  
- **Interest coverage**: 37.4x (2025), with $2.8B EBIT covering $75M annual interest[38][53].  
- **Credit rating**: A3 (Moody's), reflecting strong liquidity and $1.5B annual FCF[13][72].  

The 2025 $900M senior note issuance[56] extends maturities to 2031-2035, eliminating near-term refinancing risk. While not debt-free, TE's balance sheet provides ample recession cushion.

---

### 4. **Cyclicality (6/10)**  
TE has **mixed cyclical exposure**:  
- **Cyclical segments**: Automotive (39.5% of revenue), commercial transportation, and industrial equipment[31][52]. These markets typically decline 15-25% in recessions.  
- **Counter-cyclical drivers**: 28% of revenue from medical, aerospace/defense, and energy infrastructure—markets with multi-year contracts and slower downturns[2][8].  

Historical data shows TE's revenue declines capped at 9.5% in severe recessions (2020)[58], outperforming pure-play cyclical peers. The 2025 acquisition of Richards Manufacturing ($2.3B) further diversifies into utility infrastructure[2], reducing overall cyclicality.
