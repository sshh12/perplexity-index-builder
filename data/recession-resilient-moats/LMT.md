## Analysis

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this analysis of Lockheed Martin (LMT) based on the four criteria provided. I need to evaluate Pricing Power, Recession History, Debt Burden (inverse scoring), and Cyclicality (also inverse scoring). Let's start by going through each criterion one by one, using the search results and any existing knowledge I have.

First, Pricing Power. The user's rubric says we need to look at historical pricing trends, gross margins, competitor actions, customer concentration, brand strength, switching costs, and regulatory barriers. From the search results, Lockheed Martin's revenue is heavily tied to U.S. government contractsâ€”73% according to source [14]. That suggests high customer concentration, but the U.S. government is a reliable customer, especially for defense. The gross profit on sales for Q1 2025 was $2.32B, and in Q4 2024 it was $6.93B [1]. However, looking at the gross margin, source [12] mentions a gross margin of 10.23% for the last 12 months. That seems a bit low, but maybe typical for defense contracting. 

Lockheed's contracts are often long-term and fixed-price, as mentioned in source [3], which might limit their ability to adjust prices immediately. However, source [3] also notes that 40% of their revenue comes from cost-plus contracts where they can pass on costs. This mix could provide some pricing power. Additionally, their role as a major defense contractor with critical products like the F-35 gives them some monopoly-like power, which would score high. Competitors like Boeing have had issues (source [1] shows Boeing's gross profit was negative in Dec 2024), which might mean less competition. Switching costs for the government would be high due to the specialized nature of their products. So, considering these factors, maybe a 7 or 8 for Pricing Power.

Next, Recession History. The rubric looks at performance during past recessions. Source [4] mentions that during the 2007-09 recession, LMT had a -46% return vs. -55% for the S&P 500. That's better than the market but still a significant drop. However, the article in [13] states that LMT is considered recession-proof due to government contracts. During COVID-19, defense spending remained stable. Source [17] shows that in 2024, despite a sales increase, net earnings decreased, but that might be due to specific factors rather than a recession. Looking at the revenue history from [2], revenue has been steadily increasing except for a slight dip in 2022. During the 2020 recession, their revenue increased from $59.81B in 2019 to $65.40B in 2020 [2], suggesting resilience. So in past recessions, they've shown moderate to strong resilience. Maybe a 7 or 8 here.

Debt Burden is inverse scored. Source [9] states a debt-to-equity ratio of 303.8% (which is 3.03x), and source [8] mentions net debt of $16.2B with interest coverage of 8.7x. The rubric says Debt-to-Equity over 3x is in the 1-2 range (dangerous leverage), but interest coverage is 8.7x, which falls into the 5-6 range (moderate leverage). However, the debt-to-equity is very high. But source [10] mentions that their credit rating is A- from S&P, which is investment grade. Also, they have a significant backlog ($176B in 2024 per [17]), which provides future revenue. The high debt might be manageable given their government contracts and stable cash flows. Since the score is inverse, high debt means a lower score. But considering their ability to manage it, maybe a 5 or 6. Wait, the rubric for Debt Burden inverse: 9-10 is fortress, 7-8 conservative, etc. So a debt-to-equity of 3x would be in the 1-2 range, but maybe other factors like interest coverage and credit rating mitigate that. This is tricky. Maybe a 4?

Cyclicality inverse scoring. Defense spending is generally considered non-cyclical because governments prioritize it even in recessions. Source [4] and [13] both highlight LMT as recession-proof. Their revenue comes from long-term contracts, which are less tied to economic cycles. However, there might be some cyclicality if defense budgets are cut, but historically, U.S. defense spending is relatively stable. Source [6] mentions that during the 2008 recession, Lockheed was part of the economy that continued, though the broader economy struggled. So Cyclicality score would be high (low cyclicality), maybe 9 or 10.

Now, compiling all this into the JSON scores. Let me double-check each category.

Pricing Power: Strong (7-8) due to government contracts, cost-plus agreements, and essential products. Competitors struggling, high switching costs. Gross margin is low but stable. Maybe 8.

Recession History: They've performed better than market in past recessions, with revenue growth during 2020. The 2008 return was better than S&P. So maybe 8.

Debt Burden: High debt-to-equity (3.03x) but good interest coverage (8.7x) and strong cash flow. Inverse score, so maybe 4 (High Leverage) but considering their cash flow and government backing, maybe 5. Wait, the inverse scoring for Debt Burden: 9-10 is minimal debt. Their debt is high, so lower score. If debt-to-equity is >3x, that's 1-2, but interest coverage is 8.7x, which is 5-6. Maybe average it to 3. But the rubric says "inverse scoring where 10 = minimal debt burden." So high debt (3x D/E) would be 1-2, but interest coverage is strong. This is conflicting. Maybe the high D/E drags it down to 3, but interest coverage and credit rating push it up to 4. So maybe 4.

Cyclicality: Defense is non-cyclical. Score 9 or 10. Given that during recessions, their revenue stays stable or grows, 9.

Putting it all together:

Pricing Power: 8

Recession History: 8

Debt Burden: 4 (inverse, so high debt but manageable)

Cyclicality: 9 (inverse, low cyclicality)

Wait, but the Debt Burden criteria has inverse scoring. So a high debt burden would mean a lower score. Lockheed's D/E is over 3x, which is in the 1-2 range, but their interest coverage is 8.7x, which is in the 5-6 range. The rubric says for Debt Burden, 1-2 is dangerous leverage (D/E >3x, interest coverage <2x). But their interest coverage is 8.7x, which is in the 5-6 range (moderate leverage: D/E 1-2x, interest coverage 4-8x). However, their D/E is higher than 3x. This is conflicting. Maybe the rubric is considering both metrics. If D/E is >3x but interest coverage is 8.7x, perhaps it's between 3-4. The rubric says 3-4 is High Leverage (D/E 2-3x, interest coverage 2-4x). But their D/E is 3.03x, which is just over 3x. So maybe 3-4. But the interest coverage is higher than 4x, which might bump it up. This is a bit unclear. Maybe a 3.

Alternatively, considering that they have a strong cash flow and government backing, maybe the score is better. But per the rubric, it's based on the metrics. So if D/E is >3x, it's 1-2, but interest coverage is 8.7x, which is 5-6. Maybe average to 3.5, but since we have to give an integer, maybe 3. However, source [10] mentions that their credit rating is A-, which is stable, and they have a large backlog. So maybe the score is 4, considering they can manage the debt despite high D/E.

I think after considering all factors, the Debt Burden score would be 4.

So final scores:

Pricing Power: 8

Recession History: 8

Debt Burden: 4

Cyclicality: 9
