# Research Analysis: NSC

**Generated:** Sun Jun  1 01:00:39 2025

## Analysis

<think>
Okay, let's dive into analyzing Norfolk Southern (NSC) using the given framework. First, I need to understand each of the four criteria: Pricing Power, Recession History, Debt Burden (inverse scoring), and Cyclicality (inverse scoring). 

Starting with Pricing Power. The railroad industry is known for having some pricing power due to the oligopolistic nature of the market. There are only a few major players, which might allow them to raise prices without losing too much business. Looking at the search results, I see that Norfolk Southern has achieved inflation-plus pricing in the merchandise segment due to strong service and customer relationships [4][19][25]. Their CFO mentioned they can pass through inflation costs, which is a good sign. Gross margins have been stable, even improving in recent quarters despite some economic pressures. For example, in Q1 2025, the operating ratio improved by 200 basis points to 67.9% [17]. However, intermodal pricing is more competitive and tied to trucking rates, which could limit pricing power there. So, they have strong pricing in some segments but not across the board. That might place them around a 7 or 8.

Next, Recession History. How has NSC performed during past recessions? Looking at the 2008 financial crisis, the company's revenue dipped but recovered relatively quickly. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, they faced volume declines but managed through cost controls. In the 2023-2024 period, despite challenges like the East Palestine derailment, they maintained profitability with insurance recoveries offsetting costs [3][17]. Their revenue in 2024 was $12.1 billion, showing resilience with a slight decrease from the previous year but maintaining stable operations. They also continued paying dividends, which indicates financial stability. However, the railroad industry is somewhat tied to economic cycles, so while they aren't completely immune, their performance during downturns has been relatively stable. This might be a 7, as they showed moderate resilience with some revenue impact but maintained profitability.

Debt Burden is next, and this is inverse scoring. NSC's debt-to-equity ratio as of recent reports is around 2.7x [24][37][44]. That's on the higher side, which could be a concern. However, their interest coverage ratio is about 5.8x, which is manageable but not super strong. They have a BBB credit rating, which is investment grade, but not the highest. The debt levels have been consistent, and they have enough cash flow to cover interest payments. However, the debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 2.7, which is moderate. Given the inverse scoring, higher debt would mean a lower score. Considering the metrics, they might fall into the 5-6 range, which would translate to a score of 5 or 6 here. But since it's inverse, a higher debt burden gives a lower score. Wait, the rubric says 1-2 is dangerous leverage, 3-4 high leverage. Their debt-to-equity is 2.7x, which is above 2x, so that's 3-4. But since it's inverse, a score of 3-4 would translate to 7-6? Wait, no. The inverse scoring means that higher debt burden (which is bad) gets a lower score. So if their debt situation is in the 3-4 category (high leverage), the inverse score would be 10 - 4 = 6? Wait, maybe I need to clarify. The Debt Burden score is inverse, so a company with minimal debt gets a 10. If their debt is in the 3-4 category (high leverage), then the inverse score would be 10 - 4 = 6? Or perhaps the rubric is structured such that each category is mapped to the inverse. For example, if the debt burden is considered "High Leverage" (3-4), then the inverse score would be 10 - 3 = 7 to 10 -4 = 6. So maybe a score of 6 for Debt Burden.

Cyclicality is also inverse. Railroads typically have some cyclicality because they transport goods that are tied to economic activity, like coal, intermodal containers, and industrial products. However, some segments are more stable. For example, transporting essential goods like chemicals or agriculture might be less cyclical. NSC's revenue breakdown: 57% general merchandise, 29% intermodal, 14% coal [9]. Coal is declining but still a part. Intermodal is tied to consumer goods and retail, which can be cyclical. General merchandise includes chemicals, agriculture, which are more stable. During recessions, volumes might dip but not drastically. Historical data shows that in Q1 2025, they had 1% volume growth despite economic headwinds [17]. In past recessions, revenue declines were moderate. So their business is moderately cyclical. The rubric says "Mixed Cyclicality" (5-6) which translates to inverse score of 5-6. But since it's inverse, the score would be higher if cyclicality is low. Wait, the Cyclicality score is inverse, so lower cyclicality gets a higher score. If the company has mixed cyclicality (5-6 in the rubric), the inverse score would be 10 - 5 = 5 to 10 -6 =4? Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The Cyclicality score is inverse, so if the company is highly cyclical (1-2), the inverse score is 9-10. Wait, no. Let me check the rubric again.

The Cyclicality scoring is inverse. So the categories are:

1-2 (Highly Cyclical) → inverse score 9-10

3-4 (Moderately Cyclical) → inverse score 7-8

5-6 (Mixed) → inverse score 5-6

7-8 (Low) → inverse score 3-4

9-10 (Non-cyclical) → inverse score 1-2

Wait, no. The user instruction says: "Lower cyclicality indicates higher recession resilience. Note: This is inverse scoring where 10 = minimal cyclicality." So if the company has minimal cyclicality (non-cyclical), score 9-10. If it's highly cyclical, score 1-2. So in the rubric, the scoring is:

Highly Cyclical (1-2 in original) → inverse score 1-2

Moderately Cyclical (3-4) → inverse score 3-4

Mixed (5-6) → inverse 5-6

Low (7-8) → inverse 7-8

Non-cyclical (9-10) → inverse 9-10

Wait, no. The user wrote:

**Cyclicality (Inverse Scoring)**
This score measures how much the company's business fluctuates with economic cycles. Lower cyclicality indicates higher recession resilience. Note: This is inverse scoring where 10 = minimal cyclicality.

So the original rubric for Cyclicality is:

1-2 (Highly Cyclical): Revenue swings 50%+ → inverse score 1-2 (since 10 = minimal)

3-4 (Moderately Cyclical): 25-50% swings → inverse 3-4

5-6 (Mixed Cyclicality): 10-25% → inverse 5-6

7-8 (Low Cyclicality): <10% → inverse 7-8

9-10 (Non-cyclical): independent → inverse 9-10

But wait, the user's instruction says "Lower cyclicality indicates higher recession resilience. Note: This is inverse scoring where 10 = minimal cyclicality." So the inverse scoring means that the score is the inverse of cyclicality. So if the company is highly cyclical (original 1-2), the inverse score is 1-2. If it's low cyclicality (original 7-8), inverse score is 7-8.

So for NSC, given that they have mixed cyclicality (some segments are stable, others cyclical), their revenue swings during recessions have been moderate. For example, during the 2020 COVID recession, they faced volume declines but not catastrophic. In 2023-2024, revenue was relatively stable. So their cyclicality is probably in the 5-6 range (Mixed), which would translate to an inverse score of 5-6. But looking at their revenue breakdown, 57% is general merchandise which includes more stable sectors, so maybe their cyclicality is lower. During the 2008 recession, their revenue decreased but not as severely as highly cyclical industries. Let's say their revenue swings are around 10-25%, placing them in Mixed Cyclicality (5-6), inverse score 5-6. However, if their actual performance during recessions shows less volatility, maybe they belong in Low Cyclicality (7-8 inverse score). For example, in Q4 2024, revenue was $3.0B, slightly down from previous quarters but not drastically. So maybe they have Low Cyclicality, inverse score 7-8.

Putting it all together:

Pricing Power: 7 (Strong pricing power in some segments, moderate in others)

Recession History: 7 (Resistant, with moderate declines but maintained profitability)

Debt Burden: 4 (High leverage, inverse score 4 because debt-to-equity is 2.7x, which is in 3-4 category, so inverse is 10 -4 =6? Wait, the Debt Burden is inverse. So if the company's debt is in the 3-4 category (High Leverage), the inverse score would be 10 -4 =6? Or is the rubric mapped directly? The rubric says:

Debt Burden (Inverse Scoring):

1-2 (Dangerous Leverage) → inverse score 1-2

3-4 (High Leverage) → inverse 3-4

5-6 (Moderate) → inverse 5-6

7-8 (Conservative) → inverse 7-8

9-10 (Fortress) → inverse 9-10

So if NSC's debt is in the 3-4 category (High Leverage: debt-to-equity 2-3x, interest coverage 2-4x), then the inverse score is 3-4. Wait, but their interest coverage is 5.8x [24], which is above 4x, so maybe they are in Moderate Leverage (5-6). Debt-to-equity is 2.7x, which is above 2x, so that's High Leverage (3-4). But interest coverage is 5.8x, which is in the 4-8x range (Moderate Leverage). This is conflicting. The rubric for Debt Burden:

**3-4 (High Leverage)**: Debt-to-equity 2-3x, interest coverage 2-4x.

**5-6 (Moderate Leverage)**: Debt-to-equity 1-2x, interest coverage 4-8x.

So NSC's debt-to-equity is 2.7x (High Leverage 3-4), but interest coverage is 5.8x (Moderate 5-6). Which category do they fall into? Maybe the rubric considers the worst of the two. Or perhaps they are in High Leverage because debt-to-equity is above 2x, even if interest coverage is moderate. In that case, the inverse score would be 3-4. But the interest coverage is higher than 4x, suggesting Moderate Leverage. This is a bit conflicting. Maybe the score is 5-6 (Moderate Leverage), so inverse score 5-6. But the debt-to-equity is high. The answer might be a balance between the two metrics. Since debt-to-equity is 2.7x (High) but interest coverage is 5.8x (Moderate), perhaps they fall into Moderate Leverage (5-6), so inverse score 5-6. Therefore, the Debt Burden score would be 6.

Cyclicality: Their business is tied to economic cycles but has elements of stability. Revenue swings are moderate, maybe around 10-25%, placing them in Mixed Cyclicality (5-6), inverse score 5-6. But if their actual performance in recessions is better, maybe 7-8. Given that in 2020 they managed through without severe drops, and in 2023-2024 they maintained revenue, perhaps they are Low Cyclicality (7-8 inverse score).

After considering all factors, the scores would be:

Pricing Power: 7

Recession History: 7

Debt Burden: 6 (inverse of Moderate Leverage)

Cyclicality: 6 (inverse of Mixed Cyclicality)

But need to confirm with data. Let me check the search results again.

For Debt Burden: [24] mentions debt-to-E
