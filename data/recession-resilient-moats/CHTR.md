# Research Analysis: CHTR

**Generated:** Sun Jun  1 01:07:17 2025

## Analysis

<think>
Okay, let's dive into analyzing Charter Communications (CHTR) using the four key dimensions for recession resilience. 

Starting with **Pricing Power**, Charter operates in the telecommunications sector, providing internet, cable TV, and mobile services. The industry has moderate pricing power due to essential services, but competition is fierce. Spectrum, their brand, has been increasing prices, like the $3 hike in base internet and TV plans in July 2024 [28], but they face pressure from fiber and fixed wireless competitors. Their ability to bundle services (internet, mobile, TV) might help retain customers, but the loss of 177k internet customers in Q4 2024 [2] suggests some vulnerability. Gross margins have remained stable around 42-43% [3][18], indicating some pricing control. However, the reliance on content cost escalations for TV [28] could squeeze margins. I'd rate this around 6/10—moderate pricing power due to essential services but constrained by competition and content costs.

Moving to **Recession History**, looking at past downturns, during the 2020 COVID pandemic, internet usage surged, likely benefiting CHTR. However, in Q4 2024, they lost internet customers, possibly due to economic pressures [2]. Their revenue growth has been minimal (0.9% YoY in 2024 [17]), and EBITDA growth is modest (3.1% in 2024 [17]). During the 2008 crisis, Charter filed for bankruptcy, but that was pre-restructuring. More recently, they've maintained EBITDA growth even with subscriber losses, suggesting some resilience. Given mixed performance, a score of 5/10 seems appropriate—moderate resilience with some declines but maintained profitability.

For **Debt Burden**, CHTR has a high debt load. Their debt-to-equity ratio is 465.6% [23], and interest coverage is 2.6x [23], which is concerning. They have significant maturities ahead, though they've managed refinancing. The high leverage (debt/EBITDA around 4.1x [59]) poses risks in a downturn, especially if cash flows dip. However, they generated $4.3B FCF in 2024 [17], providing some cushion. Inverse scoring here would be low, maybe 3/10, indicating high leverage but manageable due to cash flows.

Regarding **Cyclicality**, telecom services are considered essential, but CHTR's video segment is declining, and internet faces competition. Their business isn't highly cyclical, but not immune. Revenue dipped slightly in 2024 but remained stable [17]. The shift to mobile and rural expansion might offset some cyclicality. However, discretionary video services could see cuts in recessions. Inverse score here might be 7/10—low cyclicality due to essential internet, but some exposure via video.

Putting it all together, the scores would reflect moderate pricing power, mixed recession history, high debt burden, and low cyclicality. The JSON output would encapsulate these findings.

**Charter Communications (CHTR) Recession Resilience Analysis**

---

### 1. **Pricing Power (6/10)**  
Charter demonstrates **moderate pricing power** driven by its essential broadband services and bundling strategy.  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Implemented $3/month price hikes for base internet/TV plans in 2024 despite competition [28][11], with residential ARPU growing 1.7% YoY in Q4 2024 [17].  
  - Stable gross margins (~42-44% since 2021) [3][18], reflecting managed cost structures.  
  - **Limitations**: Video segment faces content cost inflation [28], and fixed wireless/fiber competitors (e.g., T-Mobile, AT&T) constrain unilateral pricing moves [20]. Bundling (e.g., Spectrum One) aids retention but doesn’t eliminate churn (2.54M internet subscriber loss YoY in Q1 2025 [3]).  

---

### 2. **Recession History (5/10)**  
CHTR shows **mixed resilience** in downturns, with structural declines in legacy segments offset by mobile growth.  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - During 2020 COVID-19 recession: Broadband demand surged, but 2024’s macroeconomic pressures led to 177K internet subscriber losses in Q4 [2].  
  - Revenue grew only 0.9% YoY in 2024 [17], but EBITDA expanded 3.1% due to cost controls.  
  - Historical vulnerability: Filed for bankruptcy in 2009 due to pre-restructuring debt, but post-2016 acquisition of Time Warner Cable improved scale.  

---

### 3. **Debt Burden (3/10 Inverse Score)**  
High leverage remains a critical risk, mitigated by strong cash flow generation.  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - Debt-to-equity of 465.6% [23] and interest coverage of 2.6x [23] signal elevated risk.  
  - **Mitigations**: $4.3B free cash flow in 2024 [17] and $15.4B operating cash flow [54] provide liquidity. Debt maturities are staggered (95% post-2026 [60]), reducing near-term refinancing risk.  

---

### 4. **Cyclicality (7/10 Inverse Score)**  
Low cyclicality due to broadband’s essential nature, partially offset by discretionary video exposure.  
- **Key Evidence**:  
  - 70% of 2024 revenue came from internet/mobile [3][17], which are recession-resilient.  
  - Video revenue fell 8.4% YoY in Q1 2025 [54], highlighting vulnerability to cord-cutting during downturns.  
  - Rural expansion (902K subsidized passings in Q1 2025 [25]) diversifies exposure but ties growth to government programs.
