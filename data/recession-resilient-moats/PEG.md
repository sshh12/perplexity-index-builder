## Analysis

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this analysis of Public Service Enterprise Group (PEG) using the recession-resilient moats strategy framework. I need to evaluate PEG across four categories: Pricing Power, Recession History, Debt Burden, and Cyclicality. Let's start by gathering relevant information from the provided search results and other known data about the company.

**1. Pricing Power:**
PEG operates primarily through its regulated utility subsidiary, PSE&G, which provides electric and gas services in New Jersey. Regulated utilities typically have moderate pricing power because their rates are set by regulatory bodies like the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU). From the search results, we see that PSE&G recently received approval for rate increases, such as a 7% increase in October 2024 [4][10]. However, these increases are subject to regulatory approval and are often tied to infrastructure investments or cost recovery, rather than pure market dynamics. The company can't unilaterally raise prices but can petition for increases based on justified costs. During the 2025 Basic Generation Service auction, the supply portion of bills increased by 17% due to higher energy costs, which are passed through to customers [1][7]. This indicates that while PEG doesn't have full control over pricing, regulated mechanisms allow it to adjust rates in response to cost changes, especially for supply costs which are passthrough. Gross margins for utilities are generally stable, and PEG's recent rate cases show an ability to maintain margins through approved increases. However, the reliance on regulatory approvals limits pricing power compared to companies with strong brands or monopolistic control without regulation. Competitors in the utility space are limited due to the regulated monopoly structure, which provides some market dominance. Customer concentration isn't an issue since utilities serve a broad customer base, but switching costs are high as customers can't easily change providers. Overall, PEG has moderate pricing power within a regulated framework.

**2. Recession History:**
Looking at past recessions, utilities are generally considered defensive stocks because they provide essential services. The search results mention PEG's performance during recent economic challenges. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, utilities were less impacted, and PEG's regulated operations provided stability. The 2024 Q3 results showed growth in distribution margins despite economic uncertainties [11]. In the 2008 financial crisis, utilities like PEG likely saw stable revenues, as energy consumption is less elastic. The provided data doesn't show significant revenue drops during past recessions. For instance, in 2024, PEG reported a net income increase and maintained dividend growth [19]. The 2025 Q1 earnings showed a 10.7% YoY net income increase, indicating resilience [12]. PEG's revenue streams from regulated utilities provide consistent cash flow, which is less volatile. During the 2020 recession, PEG's focus on infrastructure and essential services likely buffered it from severe impacts. The company's long history of paying dividends for 118 years, with 14 consecutive annual increases, suggests stability through cycles [19]. Thus, PEG demonstrates recession resistance, with minimal revenue impact and maintained profitability during downturns.

**3. Debt Burden (Inverse Scoring):**
As of December 2024, PEG's consolidated debt was $22.7 billion, with a debt-to-equity ratio of approximately 1.4 (calculated from total debt $22.7B and equity $16.1B [16]). However, utilities typically carry higher debt due to infrastructure investments. The company's interest coverage ratio can be estimated from operating income and interest expense. In Q4 2024, operating income was $445 million, and interest expense was $232 million, giving an interest coverage of ~1.9x [16], which is low. However, the annual 2024 results show non-GAAP operating earnings of $3.68 per share, and the company maintains investment-grade credit ratings [14][15]. PEG's debt-to-equity has been managed, and they have access to credit facilities. The capital structure includes a mix of long-term debt and equity, with a focus on funding infrastructure without equity dilution [14]. The debt burden is moderate, with manageable leverage but not a fortress balance sheet. The inverse score would align with moderate leverage, considering the industry norms for utilities.

**4. Cyclicality (Inverse Scoring):**
Utilities are known for low cyclicality due to the essential nature of their services. PEG's revenue comes from regulated electric and gas distribution, which is non-discretionary. Even during recessions, households and businesses continue to use utilities. The search results indicate that PEG's revenue growth is tied to rate base investments and regulatory approvals, which are less tied to economic cycles. For example, the 2025 infrastructure projects and Clean Energy Future initiatives are long-term investments [12][14]. Historical data shows that PEG's revenue fluctuations are minimal, with steady growth driven by regulatory assets. The company's performance during the 2024 rate hikes and the 2025 supply cost adjustments [1][7] reflects stability. Thus, PEG has low cyclicality, scoring high in inverse scoring.

**Final Scores:**
- **Pricing Power**: 6 (Moderate Pricing Power) – Regulated rate increases provide some pricing control, but limited by regulatory oversight.
- **Recession History**: 8 (Recession Resistant) – Consistent performance during past downturns, stable revenues, and dividend growth.
- **Debt Burden**: 6 (Moderate Leverage) – Higher debt typical for utilities, but manageable with stable cash flows.
- **Cyclicality**: 9 (Low Cyclicality) – Essential services with minimal economic sensitivity.
