# Research Analysis: VST

**Generated:** Sun Jun  1 01:10:17 2025

## Analysis

<think>
Okay, I need to analyze Vistra Corp. (VST) based on the four criteria provided: Pricing Power, Recession History, Debt Burden, and Cyclicality. Let's start by going through each category step by step using the search results and any other available information.

First, Pricing Power. The user mentioned looking at historical pricing trends, gross margin stability, competitor actions, brand strength, etc. Vistra operates in the utilities sector, specifically electric utilities and power generation. Utilities generally have some pricing power because they're essential services, but VST is in a deregulated market (like Texas), which might mean more competition. The search results indicate they have a vertically integrated model, which could help with cost control. However, in deregulated markets, customers can switch providers, so Vistra might not have as strong pricing power as regulated utilities. Their gross margin was 41.31% according to Stock Analysis [10], which is decent. But in a competitive market, they might not be able to raise prices significantly without losing customers. Also, their retail segment serves residential and commercial customers, which could be price-sensitive. So maybe moderate pricing power? Let's check if they have any unique advantages. They have nuclear and renewable assets, which might be more stable. The recent acquisition of Energy Harbor added nuclear plants, which are cost-competitive and might provide stable pricing. But in a deregulated market, pricing is still subject to market rates. So maybe a 6 or 7 for pricing power?

Next, Recession History. The user wants to know how VST performed during past recessions. Looking at the financials, in 2024, they had a net income of $2.467B, up from $1.343B in 2023, which was a significant increase [29]. During COVID (2020), their stock hit a low in March 2020 but recovered. In Q1 2025, they reported a net loss of $268M, but this was due to mark-to-market losses on hedges, not operational issues [68]. Their EBITDA has been growing, and they reaffirmed guidance despite volatility. During the 2008 recession, as a utility, they might have been more resilient, but Vistra's current form post-2016 (after Energy Future Holdings bankruptcy) might not have a long track record. In the 2020 pandemic, they managed through, and their recent performance shows growth. Their revenue has been increasing, with 2024 revenue at $17.22B, up 16.5% [10]. Maybe a 7 or 8 here because they've maintained operations and even grew through acquisitions, but not entirely recession-proof.

Debt Burden. The user uses inverse scoring, so lower debt is better. According to Simply Wall St [11], VST has a debt-to-equity ratio of 360% (17.4B debt vs 4.8B equity), which is very high. Interest coverage is 4.1x, which is low. The S&P upgrade in 2024 mentioned net leverage of ~2.7x [12], but that's adjusted. However, the Moody's downgrade in 2025 [13] mentions adjusted debt/EBITDA improving to 6.2x in 2025 from 6.8x in 2024, which is still high. Their debt is significant, so this would be a low score. Based on the rubric, debt-to-equity over 3x is Dangerous Leverage (1-2). But the user's rubric for Debt Burden is inverse, so a high debt burden would score low. So a score of 2 here, translating to a 2 in the inverse scale.

Cyclicality. Utilities are generally low cyclicality. However, VST operates in competitive markets, and their performance can be affected by energy prices. They have hedging in place (100% for 2025, 80% for 2026 [18]), which reduces volatility. Their business includes retail electricity, which is essential, but in deregulated markets, there might be more sensitivity. The search results mention they supply data centers, which could be growing but might be less cyclical. Overall, utilities are low cyclical, but being in a competitive market might add some variability. Maybe a 7 or 8 here. Since the rubric scores inversely, lower cyclicality gets a higher score. If they have low cyclicality, score 8, which would be 8 in inverse.

Putting it all together:

Pricing Power: 6 (Moderate)
Recession History: 7 (Resistant)
Debt Burden: 2 (Dangerous Leverage, inverse score 2)
Cyclicality: 8 (Low Cyclicality, inverse score 8)

But wait, need to double-check each category again.

Pricing Power: In a deregulated market, but with some vertical integration and nuclear assets. They might have moderate power. Gross margin is 41%, which is stable. Competitors like NRG, but VST has a significant market share in Texas. Maybe a 6.

Recession History: They've managed through recent downturns with growth, even expanding. Their EBITDA has been increasing, and they've shown resilience. So maybe 7.

Debt Burden: High leverage, debt/equity over 3x, interest coverage 4.1x. That's in the Dangerous Leverage category (1-2), so inverse score 2.

Cyclicality: As a utility, even in deregulated markets, demand is steady. Their hedging reduces exposure to energy price swings. So low cyclicality, inverse score 8.

Final scores:

Pricing Power: 6

Recession History: 7

Debt Burden: 2 (inverse)

Cyclicality: 8 (inverse)

### Comprehensive Analysis of Vistra Corp. (VST)

#### **1. Pricing Power (Score: 6/10)**  
Vistra operates in competitive, deregulated electricity markets (e.g., ERCOT in Texas), limiting traditional utility pricing power. However, its vertically integrated model—combining generation (nuclear, natural gas, renewables) and retail operations—provides partial insulation. Nuclear assets acquired via Energy Harbor (2024) offer low marginal costs and stability, while long-term hedging (100% of 2025 generation, 80% of 2026) reduces exposure to volatile wholesale prices [12][18]. Gross margins stabilized at 41.3% [10], but retail competition in deregulated markets constrains unilateral price hikes. Pricing power is **moderate**, as Vistra benefits from operational diversification but lacks monopolistic advantages.

---

#### **2. Recession History (Score: 7/10)**  
Vistra demonstrated resilience during recent downturns:  
- **COVID-19 (2020):** Shares rebounded swiftly after March 2020 lows, supported by stable electricity demand.  
- **2022–2023 Energy Crisis:** Capitalized on Texas grid volatility, with revenue rising 16.5% YoY to $17.2B in 2024 [10].  
- **Q1 2025 Net Loss:** A $268M GAAP loss stemmed from non-cash derivative markdowns, not operational weakness [68]. Adjusted EBITDA grew 53% YoY, reflecting structural hedging and retail customer growth.  
Historical performance suggests **recession resistance**, though not full immunity, as seen in moderate revenue swings (-5.6% gross profit decline in Q1 2025 [9]).

---

#### **3. Debt Burden (Inverse Score: 2/10)**  
Vistra’s leverage remains elevated:  
- **Debt/Equity:** 360% ($17.4B debt vs. $4.8B equity) [11].  
- **Interest Coverage:** 4.1x EBITDA [11], below the 5x safety threshold.  
- **Moody’s Downgrade (2025):** Adjusted debt/EBITDA projected at 6.2x in 2025, down from 6.8x in 2024 [71].  
While liquidity is strong ($3.9B as of Q1 2025 [68]), high refinancing risk and reliance on free cash flow ($3.0–3.6B guidance [68]) warrant caution. This aligns with **dangerous leverage**, scoring low on inverse metrics.

---

#### **4. Cyclicality (Inverse Score: 7/10)**  
Electricity demand is inherently non-discretionary, but Vistra’s exposure to merchant power markets introduces cyclicality:  
- **Demand Sensitivity:** Industrial/commercial segments (~40% of revenue [4]) correlate with economic activity.  
- **Hedging Mitigation:** 100% of 2025 generation hedged locks in cash flows, reducing volatility [18].  
- **Counter-Cyclical Opportunities:** Data center growth (e.g., Amazon, Microsoft partnerships [68]) offsets cyclical risks.  
Overall, Vistra exhibits **low cyclicality** due to essential services but retains moderate exposure through unregulated operations.

---

### Final Scores  
```json
{
  "pricing_power": 6,
  "recession_history": 7,
  "debt_burden": 2,
  "cyclicality": 7
}
```  

**Conclusion**: Vistra’s integrated model and hedging provide recession resilience, but high leverage and competitive retail markets temper its moat. Prioritize monitoring debt reduction progress and energy market volatility.
