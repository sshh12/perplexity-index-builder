3. **Technology Stack**: Proprietary AI/ML infrastructure, models, datasets
4. **Market Position**: Competitive advantages through AI capabilities
5. **Management Vision**: Leadership commitment to AI-first strategy
6. **Recent Developments**: Latest AI initiatives, partnerships, acquisitions
7. **Financial Performance**: Growth metrics tied to AI capabilities
8. **Risk Assessment**: Dependency on AI trends, regulatory risks

## Scoring Criteria

Provide scores (1-10 scale) for:

**AI Nativeness (1-10)**: How fundamentally AI-driven is this company?
- 1-3: Traditional company with minimal AI integration
- 4-6: Company adopting AI for efficiency/optimization
- 7-8: AI-powered business model with significant competitive advantage

## Output Format

Your analysis should end with a JSON object containing your scores:

  "confidence": Z
}

Where confidence (1-10) represents how certain you are about your assessment based on available information.
